# IS 597PR Final Project Spring 2024
# Analyzing the factors that have influenced the price of Cryptocurrencies over the years


## Abstract -

The project aims to study the factors influencing the prices of Cryptocurrencies. 
Crypto prices are highly volatile because it is influenced by supply and demand, public sentiments and certain 
economic factors. The project aims to investigate these factors that drive the price of Cryptocurrencies.
Through this project, I hope to demonstrate how economic trends like Inflation, Federal Interest Rates  
and Unemployment rate; public opinion have affected Bitcoin’s value. I plan to analyze how tweets can have a 
influence on Bitcoin’s price.

## Hypotheses -

*  Social Media opinions can positively or negatively impact the price of cryptocurrencies based on the sentiment.
*  Low Unemployment rates can lead to increase in Cryptocurrency prices, and vice versa
*  The Federal Interest rates have a strong influence over Cryptocurrency prices
*  Rise in inflation can cause the prices of Cryptocurrencies to decrease
*  Cryptocurrency has similar trends to that of the US Dollar
